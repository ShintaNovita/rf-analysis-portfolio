## RF Analysis Report

### 1. Background
This report summarizes RF post-processing analysis based on drive test data for portfolio demonstration purposes.

### 2. Data Overview
The dataset used in this analysis is anonymized or simulated and represents typical RF drive test parameters.

### 3. Key Findings
- Areas with low signal strength indicating potential coverage issues
- Correlation between SINR and throughput performance
- Locations requiring further field investigation

### 4. Mapping Results
Coverage and throughput maps are generated using QGIS to visualize RF performance spatially.

### 5. Conclusion
This report demonstrates a basic RF analysis workflow intended to support field and planning teams.

### 6. Limitations
Results are indicative and require validation using live network data and field verification.

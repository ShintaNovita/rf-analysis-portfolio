## RF Issue Identification

This document describes common RF performance issues identified during post-processing of drive test data.

### Key Indicators
- Low RSRP values indicating potential coverage gaps
- SINR degradation affecting downlink throughput
- Mobility anomalies suggesting possible missing neighbor relations

### Analysis Method
RF issues are identified through KPI trend review and spatial analysis using post-processing tools and mapping visualization.

### Purpose
This analysis supports field and planning teams by highlighting areas that may require further investigation or optimization.
